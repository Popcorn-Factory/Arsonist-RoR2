## Changelog

- 3.0.2
    - Fixed the damage types from being loaded to late.
- 3.0.1
    - Recompiled to support new method signatures
    - Added proper Damage changes to get skill slot specific items to work.
- 3.0.0
    - Added Scepter support!
        - Scepter changes how Primary functions:
            - Fireball becomes **Firestorm**
                - Fire a piercing beam of intense heat that deals 300% damage and ignites enemies on hit.
                - If held held for short time, fire a destructive beam that deals 450% damage when released.
            - Dragon's Breath becomes **Dante's Rebuke**
                - Fire an intense beam that deals 140% damage per tick.
                - Has increased chance to ignite the closer you are to the target.
                - If held for 2 seconds or more, Fire a final beam on release for 150% damage. 
    - Added one new special!
        - Spite
            - At 5 stacks of Anticipation, activating Spite grants Double-Tap, which fires two volleys for the heat cost of one!
                - For Alternate-primary, this is simply an attack speed buff with no extra heat cost penalty.
            - Arsonist heals for 5% of his damage while in this state
            - Arsonist Gains movespeed while under the influence of Spite.
            - Arsonist *does not* gain an aura that constantly damages enemies while in this state.
            - Anticipation stacks are not fully exhausted, but rather only the amount used when in this state is consumed at a rate of 1 stack to 1 second. However there is a minimum cost of 1 to activate, and 1 to deactivate.
            - Arsonist explodes at the end of this state for 70% damage at base, multiplied by the amount of stacks used, up to a default maximum of 10 stacks.
    - Miscellaneous changes:
        - Added force on detonation for Masochism and Spite.
        - Added VFX for Masochism on detonation. 

- 2.2.3
    - Fixed an issue regarding Masochism where the final blast would not apply any damage whatsoever due to a previous fix that reordered how the damage was applied.
        - Will add a VFX effect for the explosion down the line, not for this update.
- 2.2.2
    - Fixed an issue where Eclipse 5 / Typhoon difficulty didn't trigger a change due to wrong checks.
    - Removed Soft dependencies on SS2 and HIFU's Inferno as it is not required for the unlocks to still work. (You can still unlock firebug with SS2 typhoon.)
- 2.2.1
    - Fixed a case where Masochism couldn't end properly because buffs were erroring before the masochism flag could be set to off.
- 2.2.0
    - Updated to support SotS.
    - Fixed an issue where Masochism loop plays constantly when running while changing stage.
- 2.1.10
    - Added SFX slider independent of the inbuilt SFX slider in Voice/Volume config.
    - As suggested before, please use RiskOfOptions to dynamically change this value during runtime!
- 2.1.9
    - Lowered Base animation speed on the sprint cycle.
    - Modified the Overview description.
- 2.1.8

- 2.1.7
    - Added Unique voice line for Firebug skin when firing flare.
    - Separated voice lines from SFX
        - The voice volume slider in the settings can now affect Zero Point Blast, Masochism and Idle lines.
    - Voice lines can be controlled by the volume slider, and is now separate to the SFX slider provided in the settings.
- 2.1.6
    - Fixed some applications of burn damage was not applying the proper attacker and therefore not granting money on kill.
        - e.g: Flare DoT was not granting money.
    - Fixed the Passive from not reducing fire damage. Reduces the total damage of the DoT proc to the config value provided (50%)
    - Fixed the Fireball projectile from despawning early, should last 10s at least.
- 2.1.5
    - Changed some descriptions on some moves to be more succinct
    - Added UI element to show how many Anticipations stocks are shown 
        - Up to 10, doesn't show more than 10 but if the config is changed it will still calculate in the background
            - The buff counter at the bottom still counts the stacks.
    - Fixing images on Readme, broken cause I was stupid and used Discord as a CDN lmao
- 2.1.4
    - Purity stacking was reducing the energy cost of abilities to 0, changed to only affect heat changed in masochism controller.
        - More purity = More heat changed without showing the heat changed in the gauge.
    - Null checks on effects before executing any changes.
    - Preparations for other things (not a big update don't get hyped.)
- 2.1.3
    - Added Config option to turn off the Heat Haze effects on Dragon's Fury/Masochism.
    - Attempted to fix the bright orange material on spawn in multiplayer instances.
- 2.1.2
    - Added tokens for Arsonist specific text:
        - Overheating Text
        - Cooling Text
        - Overheating EX Text
    - Dragon's Fury changes
        - Increasing flame chance back from 70% to 90% chance to flame at close range.
        - Energy Cost is now 15 units instead of 20 units per second.
    - Attempting to scale heat gauge with actual stocks instead of specific items.
    - Fixed Cleanse and possibly other issues from propping up not activating the intended effect.
- 2.1.1
    - Fixing the Zero Point Blast from not applying the cooldown correctly on Overheat.
    - Base ZPB Cooldown decreased from 11 seconds -> 9 seconds
        - Similarly the ZPB cooldown in non-overheat is still 60% of the base cooldown (6.6s -> 5.4s)
    - ZPB Damage coefficient 400% -> 200% 
    - ZPB Blast Radius on contact 5 units -> 3 units
    - ZPB Starting speed 600% -> 700% of current speed.
    - Attempted to mitigate Arsonist from bonking against his own fireball. (This may still happen, but should happen less. Particulary an issue when aiming down, but should no longer be too much of an issue. May happen on higher attack speeds.)
    - Fixing Cooldowns from being set incorrectly when overheating and a move isn't used but still applies the longer cooldown.
    - Fixed an issue where pyromania would activate even though a player had Safer Spaces equipped. Safer Spaces should be used first before Pyromania passive is triggered.
    - Dragon's Breath now should consume heat at a constant rate, as it is no longer tied to tick rate or attack speed.
        - As such, now the rate is 20 units of heat a second. (Or so at least that's what I think it's around, I dunno it's goddamn 2am in the morning and I spent so long trying to find a solution GOD PLEASE I JUST NEED SOME SLEEP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.)
        - Activating Dragon's Breath disables heat regeneration for 0.2 seconds.
- 2.1.0
    - Added a voiceline that plays by chance (chance is configurable) on Signal Flare. (Only applicable to Arsonist and Yuppie skins, not Firebug.)
    - Added "Better AI". Should make Umbras actually a challenge, and goobos actually do something.
- 2.0.4
    - Supercritical Gauge was not setting damage correctly for clients, this should be fixed now.
- 2.0.3
    - Tweaking Supercritical Gauge:
        - 3x -> 2.5x damage buff in blue portion of the gauge
        - 0.9x -> 0.7x damage debuff in white portion of the gauge
        - Reduced the maximum amount of blue that can be built up from stock items from 90% -> 75% of available heat.
        - Modified the description to indicate the downside.
        - Starting segments for white and blue portions have been changed
            - White: 60% -> 65% of gauge
            - Blue: 30% -> 25% of gauge
    - Tweaking Dragon's Fury:
        - Normal damage coefficient 70% -> 90%
        - Overheating in Dragon's Fury damage coefficient 65% -> 60%
        - Range 25 -> 35 units
        - Overheated Range 16.5 -> 23.1 units
        - Heat Cost 5 -> 6
            - Heat build up is now independant of tick. So this needed to be increased.
        - Reduced Fire Chance, 90% -> 70% chance per tick to inflict ignite when right up in their face. (If hitting all ticks in a given attack, 0.001% -> 0.00729% chance of not burning.
            - Needless to say, it's pretty a damn low chance that you'll not burn the enemy *at least once* after blasting them in the face with this attack.)
        - Increased Flamethrower radius 1 -> 1.25, should be easier to hit enemies with the flamethrower.
        - Turned on smart collision for bullet attacks. Should hit enemies better.
        - Scaling for distance to burn targets has been buffed (TLDR; burning an enemy has a higher chance at a further distance.)
            - Furthest distance (at 50 units away from target) 0% -> 13% chance to burn
            - Closest distance for max burn chance changed from 0 units to 10 units.
- 2.0.2
    - Flamethrower unlock was bugged, Should be fixed now.
        - Was me being stupid. Sorry about that. Feel free to unlock it using Cheat Unlocks.
    - MORE NULL REFERENCE ERROR FIXES
        - Fixed NRE returned from hitting Dragon's Fury on an object with a character body but with no master.
